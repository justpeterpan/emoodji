## About the Project (aka [Hackathon Checklist](https://www.madewithsupabase.com/launch-week-5))

[live demo](https://emoooodji.netlify.app/)

![Website Screenshot](docs/screen.png)  
Simple webapp to track your mood throughout the week.  

- Makes use of the magic link login auth functionality provided by [supabase](https://supabase.com/).
- Stores tracked moods in supabase and is secured by RLS + policies.
- Motivated by our day job and biweekly retrospectives, we aimed for a simple and easy to use app, to track our mood changes throughout our sprints - without any friction (looking at you unnecessary registrations & forgotten passwords). and a top notch DX by supabase made the challenge more than fun. 
- We've used the opportunity to familiarize ourselves with new technologies (vue3 & Nuxt3, coming from vue2 & Nuxt2)
- Started with [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/gtbyYsAGDegRKjoLdCQZmg/emoodji?node-id=0%3A1), ended up in voicechat fixing last bugs (more to come...)
- Future plans: fixing bugs, adding more features (launch week 5 gave us even more inspiration)
